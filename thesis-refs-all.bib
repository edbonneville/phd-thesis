  abstract = {Physicians utilize different types of information to predict patient prognosis. For example: confronted with a new patient suffering from severe aortic stenosis (AS), the cardiologist considers not only the severity of the AS but also patient characteristics, medical history, and markers such as BNP. Intuitively, doctors adjust their prediction of prognosis over time, with the change in clinical status, aortic valve area and BNP at each outpatient clinic visit. With the help of novel statistical approaches to model outcomes, it is now possible to construct dynamic event prediction models, employing longitudinal data such as AVA and BNP, and mimicking the dynamic adjustment of prognosis as employed intuitively by cardiologists. We illustrate dynamic prediction of patient survival and freedom from intervention, using baseline patient characteristics and longitudinal BNP data that are becoming available over time, from a cohort of patients with severe aortic stenosis.},

The Disease Risk Index (DRI) was developed for this purpose. In this study, we analyzed 13\,131 patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who underwent HCT between 2008 and 2010. The DRI stratified patients into 4 groups with 2-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 64\% to 24\% and was the strongest prognostic factor, regardless of age, conditioning intensity, graft source, or donor type. A randomly selected training subgroup of 9849 patients was used to refine the DRI, using a multivariable regression model for OS. This refined DRI had improved prediction ability for the remaining 3282 patients compared with the original DRI or other existing schemes. This validated and refined DRI can be used as a 4- or 3-group index, depending on the size of the cohort under study, for prognostication; to facilitate the interpretation of single-center, multicenter, or registry studies; to adjust center outcome data; and to stratify patients entering clinical trials that enroll patients across disease categories.},

Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible.

We studied 9 patients with multiple myeloma who received myeloablative therapy and T-cell\textendash depleted allogeneic BMT followed 6 months later by infusion of lymphocytes from the same donor. DLI consisted of 3\,\texttimes\,107 CD4+ donor T cells per kilogram obtained after in vitro depletion of CD8+ cells. Cell surface phenotype of peripheral lymphocytes, T-cell receptor (TCR) V{$\beta$} repertoire, TCR rearrangement excision circles (TRECs), and hematopoietic chimerism were studied in the first 6 months after BMT and for 1 year after DLI. These studies were also performed in 7 patients who received similar myeloablative therapy and BMT but without DLI. Phenotypic reconstitution of T and natural killer cells was similar in both groups, but patients who received CD4+ DLI developed increased numbers of CD20+ B cells. TCR V{$\beta$} repertoire complexity was decreased at 3 and 6 months after BMT but improved more rapidly in patients who received DLI (P\,=\,.01). CD4+ DLI was also associated with increased numbers of TRECs in CD3+ T cells (P\,\&lt;\,.001) and with conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis (P\,=\,.05). These results provide evidence that prophylactic infusion of CD4+ donor lymphocytes 6 months after BMT enhances reconstitution of donor T cells and conversion to donor hematopoiesis as well as promoting antitumor immunity.},

When missingness occurs only in the covariates, a simple approach is to use missing indicators to handle the partially observed covariates. The missing indicator approach has been criticized for giving biased results in outcome regression. However, recent papers have suggested that the missing indicator approach can provide unbiased results in propensity score analysis under certain assumptions. We consider assumptions under which the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences, namely, (1) no unmeasured confounding within missingness patterns; either (2a) covariate values of patients with missing data were conditionally independent of treatment or (2b) these values were conditionally independent of outcome; and (3) the outcome model is correctly specified: specifically, the true outcome model does not include interactions between missing indicators and fully observed covariates. We prove that, under the assumptions above, the missing indicator approach with outcome regression can provide unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. We use a simulation study to investigate the extent of bias in estimates of the treatment effect when the assumptions are violated and we illustrate our findings using data from electronic health records. In conclusion, the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences for outcome regression, but the plausibility of its assumptions must first be considered carefully.},

When missing values occur in these baseline covariates, they may be discarded as part of a complete-case analysis or multiply imputed. In the latter case, the imputations may be performed either compatibly with a substantive model pre-specified as a cause-specific Cox model [substantive model compatible fully conditional specification (SMC-FCS)], or approximately so [multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE)]. In a large simulation study, we assessed the performance of these three different methods in terms of estimating cause-specific regression coefficients and predicting cumulative incidence functions. Concerning regression coefficients, results provide further support for use of SMC-FCS over MICE, particularly when covariate effects are large and the baseline hazards of the competing events are substantially different. Complete-case analysis also shows adequate performance in settings where missingness is not outcome dependent. With regard to cumulative incidence prediction, SMC-FCS and MICE are performed more similarly, as also evidenced in the illustrative analysis of competing outcomes following a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The findings are discussed alongside recommendations for practising statisticians.},

Methods Immune cell subset counts were determined at 1\textendash 24 months post-transplant in 125 HCT recipients who received ATG during conditioning. Subset counts were also determined in 46 non-ATG-conditioned patients (similarly treated). Results (i) Reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was fast for innate immune cells, intermediate for B cells and CD8 T cells, and very slow for CD4 T cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) (iNKT) cells. (ii) Faster reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was associated with a higher number of cells of the same subset transferred with the graft in the case of memory B cells, naive CD4 T cells, naive CD8 T cells, iNKT cells and myeloid dendritic cells; lower recipient age in the case of naive CD4 T cells and naive CD8 T cells; cytomegalovirus recipient seropositivity in the case of memory/effector T cells; an absence of GvHD in the case of naive B cells; lower ATG serum levels in the case of most T-cell subsets, including iNKT cells; and higher ATG levels in the case of NK cells and B cells. (iii) Compared with non-ATG-conditioned HCT, reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was slower for CD4 T cells, and faster for NK cells and B cells. Conclusions ATG worsens the reconstitution of CD4 T cells but improves the reconstitution of NK and B cells.},

Expert opinion: Ex vivo depletion of donor T-cells prevents both acute and chronic GVHD without the need for any additional posttransplant immunological prophylaxis either in haploidentical HSCT and HLA matched transplants. Three prospective trials evaluating the efficacy of ATG in matched unrelated donor transplant recipients demonstrated that ATG reduces the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD without a significant increase of relapse rate, and similar results have been reported in the setting of blood stem cell grafts from matched sibling donors.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

  abstract = {Allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment option for patients suffering from chemotherapy-refractory or relapsed hematological malignancies. The occurrence of morbidity and mortality after allo-HCT is still high. This is partly correlated with the immunological recovery of the T cell subsets, of which the dynamics and relations to complications are still poorly understood. Detailed information on T cell subset recovery is crucial to provide tools for better prediction and modulation of adverse events. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, iNKT cells, Treg cells, MAIT cells and naive and memory T cell reconstitution, as well as their relations to outcome, considering different cell sources and immunosuppressive therapies. We conclude that the T cell subsets reconstitute in different ways and are associated with distinct adverse and beneficial events; however, adequate reconstitution of all the subsets is associated with better overall survival. Although the exact mechanisms involved in the reconstitution of each T cell subset and their associations with allo-HCT outcome need to be further elucidated, the data and suggestions presented here point towards the development of individualized approaches to improve their reconstitution. This includes the modulation of immunotherapeutic interventions based on more detailed immune monitoring, aiming to improve overall survival changes.},

  abstract = {BackgroundMissing data are a potential source of bias, and their handling in the statistical analysis can have an important impact on both the likelihood and degree of such bias. Inadequate handling of the missing data may also result in invalid variance estimation. The handling of missing values is more complex in cluster randomised trials, but there are no reviews of practice in this field.ObjectivesA systematic review of published trials was conducted to examine how missing data are reported and handled in cluster randomised trials.MethodsWe systematically identified cluster randomised trials, published in English in 2011, using the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) via PubMed. Non-randomised and pilot/feasibility trials were excluded, as were reports of secondary analyses, interim analyses, and economic evaluations and those where no data were at the individual level. We extracted information on missing data and the statistical methods used to deal with them from a random sample of the identified studies.ResultsWe included 132 trials. There was evidence of missing data in 95 (72\%). Only 32 trials reported handling missing data, 22 of them using a variety of single imputation techniques, 8 using multiple imputation without accommodating the clustering and 2 stating that their likelihood-based complete case analysis accounted for missing values because the data were assumed Missing-at-Random.LimitationsThe results presented in this study are based on a large random sample of cluster randomised trials published in 2011, identified in electronic searches and therefore possibly missing some trials, most likely of poorer quality. Also, our results are based on information in the main publication for each trial. These reports may omit some important information on the presence of, and reasons for, missing data and on the statistical methods used to handle them. Our extraction methods, based on published reports, could not distinguish between missing data in outcomes and missing data in covariates. This distinction may be important in determining the assumptions about the missing data mechanism necessary for complete case analyses to be valid.ConclusionsMissing data are present in the majority of cluster randomised trials. However, they are poorly reported, and most authors give little consideration to the assumptions under which their analysis will be valid. The majority of the methods currently used are valid under very strong assumptions about the missing data, whose plausibility is rarely discussed in the corresponding reports. This may have important consequences for the validity of inferences in some trials. Methods which result in valid inferences under general Missing-at-Random assumptions are available and should be made more accessible.},

  abstract = {In most situations, simple techniques for handling missing data (such as complete case analysis, overall mean imputation, and the missing-indicator method) produce biased results, whereas imputation techniques yield valid results without complicating the analysis once the imputations are carried out. Imputation techniques are based on the idea that any subject in a study sample can be replaced by a new randomly chosen subject from the same source population. Imputation of missing data on a variable is replacing that missing by a value that is drawn from an estimate of the distribution of this variable. In single imputation, only one estimate is used. In multiple imputation, various estimates are used, reflecting the uncertainty in the estimation of this distribution. Under the general conditions of so-called missing at random and missing completely at random, both single and multiple imputations result in unbiased estimates of study associations. But single imputation results in too small estimated standard errors, whereas multiple imputation results in correctly estimated standard errors and confidence intervals. In this article we explain why all this is the case, and use a simple simulation study to demonstrate our explanations. We also explain and illustrate why two frequently used methods to handle missing data, i.e., overall mean imputation and the missing-indicator method, almost always result in biased estimates.},

At engraftment 80 patients had high counts ({$>$} 22.2/mm3) and 43 had low counts. At 60 days post-transplant 84 patients had high counts ({$>$} 18.2/mm3) and 38 had low counts.

We investigated whether a multi-state model would give insight into the events after transplantation in a cohort of patients who were transplanted using a strategy including scheduled donor lymphocyte infusions. Seventy-eight consecutive patients who underwent myeloablative T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were studied. We constructed a multi-state model to analyze the impact of donor lymphocyte infusion and graft-versus-host disease on the probabilities of relapse and non-relapse mortality over time. Based on this model we introduced a new measure for outcome after transplantation which we called `treatment success': being alive without relapse and immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease. All relevant clinical events were implemented into the multi-state model and were denoted treatment success or failure (either transient or permanent). Both relapse and non-relapse mortality were causes of failure of comparable magnitude. Whereas relapse was the dominant cause of failure from the transplantation state, its rate was reduced after graft-versus-host disease, and especially after donor lymphocyte infusion. The long-term probability of treatment success was approximately 40\%. This probability was increased after donor lymphocyte infusion. Our multi-state model helps to interpret the impact of post-transplantation interventions and clinical events on failure and treatment success, thus extracting more information from observational data.},

However, GVHD results in substantial mortality and long-term morbidity. T-cell depletion (TCD) of the graft reduces the severity of GVHD, but is associated with an increased relapse rate after alloSCT. Therefore, early sequential donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is likely to be necessary for a successful GVL reaction. Twenty-five adult ALL patients (10 Ph+ALL) were eligible for early DLI after initial disease control with myeloablative TCD-alloSCT in first CR (CR1), if active GVHD was absent at 3\textendash 6\,months after alloSCT. Patients with a sibling donor or an unrelated donor were scheduled for 3.0 \texttimes{} 106 CD3+ cells/kg or 1.5 \texttimes{} 106 CD3+ cells/kg, respectively, at 6\,months after alloSCT. Three patients died before evaluation (one early relapse). Five patients had active GVHD. Fourteen of the remaining seventeen patients received DLI (median time-to-DLI: 185\,days). Overall, only 17\% required long-term systemic immunosuppression for GVHD. With a median follow-up after TCD-alloSCT of 50\,months, 2-year survival probability was 68\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 49\textendash 87\%).

Areas covered: A systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and abstracts of international congresses is performed to investigate immune recovery posttransplant. In this review, we discuss the pattern of immune recovery in the post-transplant period focusing on the impact of stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood) on immune recovery and HSCT outcome. We examine the impact of serotherapy on immune reconstitution and the need to tailor dosing of serotherapy agents when using different stem cell sources. We discuss new techniques being used particularly with cord blood and haploidentical grafts to improve immune recovery in each scenario. Expert opinion: Cord blood T cells provide a unique CD4+ biased immune reconstitution. Initial studies using targeted serotherapy with cord grafts showed improved immune recovery with limited alloreactivity. Two competing haploidentical approaches have developed in recent years including TCR{$\alpha\beta$}/CD19 depleted grafts and post-cyclophosphamide haplo-HSCT. Both approaches have comparable survival rates with limited alloreactivity. However, delayed immune reconstitution is still an ongoing problem and could be improved by modified donor lymphocyte infusions from the same haploidentical donor.},

  abstract = {Missing data occur in many types of studies and typically complicate the analysis. Multiple imputation, either using joint modeling or the more flexible fully conditional specification approach, are popular and work well in standard settings. In settings involving nonlinear associations or interactions, however, incompatibility of the imputation model with the analysis model is an issue often resulting in bias. Similarly, complex outcomes such as longitudinal or survival outcomes cannot be adequately handled by standard implementations. In this paper, we introduce the R package JointAI, which utilizes the Bayesian framework to perform simultaneous analysis and imputation in regression models with incomplete covariates. Using a fully Bayesian joint modeling approach it overcomes the issue of uncongeniality while retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification multiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and imputation models as a sequence of univariate models that can be adapted to the type of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof as well as survival models and joint models for longitudinal and survival data, that take arguments analogous to the corresponding well known functions for the analysis of complete data from base R and other packages. Usage and features of JointAI are described and illustrated using various examples and the theoretical background is outlined.},

The antitumor effect against hematologic malignancies is mediated by a polyclonal T-cell response targeting polymorphic antigens expressed on hematopoietic tissues of the recipient, leaving donor hematopoiesis in the patient after transplantation unharmed. Fortunately, hematopoietic tissues (including malignant hematopoietic cell populations) are relatively susceptible to T-cell recognition. If, however, nonhematopoietic tissues of the recipient are targeted as well, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) will occur. The balance between GVT and GVHD is influenced by the genetic disparity between donor and recipient, the number and origin of professional antigen-presenting cells provoking the immune response, the target antigen specificity, magnitude and diversity of the response, and the in vivo inflammatory environment, whereas inhibitory factors may silence the immune response. Manipulation of each of these factors will determine the balance between GVT and GVHD.},

  abstract = {Although allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for hematologic neoplasms, one of its limiting toxicities continues to be graft-versus-host disease, both acute (aGVHD) and chronic (cGVHD). Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor that has proven effective in GVHD prophylaxis in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, such as tacrolimus. The impact of sirolimus on immune reconstitution has not been comprehensively investigated in vivo thus far, however. Here we present an ancillary analysis of the randomized study BMT-CTN 0402 that examined the effect of sirolimus on immune subsets post-transplantation. We further examine the association between different lymphocyte subsets and outcomes post-transplantation in each arm. BMT-CTN 0402 was a randomized trial (n\,=\,304) comparing 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens, tacrolimus/sirolimus (Tac/Sir) and tacrolimus/methotrexate (Tac/MTX), in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing myeloablative HLA-matched HCT. There were no differences in 114-day GVHD-free survival (primary endpoint), aGVHD, cGVHD, relapse, or overall survival (OS) between the 2 arms. Of the 304 patients, 264 had available samples for the current immune reconstitution analysis. Blood samples were collected at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-HCT. Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed at the project laboratory (Esoterix Clinical Trials Services) in a blinded fashion, and results for the 2 arms were compared. Multivariable Cox regression models, treating each phenotypic parameter as a time-dependent variable, were constructed to study the impact of reconstitution on clinical outcomes. There were no significant differences in patient and transplantation characteristics between the Tac/Sir and Tac/MTX arms in this analysis. Absolute lymphocyte count and CD3+ cell, CD4+ cell, and conventional T cell (Tcon) counts were significantly decreased in the Tac/Sir arm for up to 3 months post-HCT, whereas CD8+ cells recovered even more slowly (up to 6 months) in this arm. Interestingly, there was no clear difference in the absolute number of regulatory T cells (Tregs, defined as CD4+CD25+ cells) between the 2 arms at any point post-HCT; however, the Treg:Tcon ratio was significantly greater in the Tac/Sir arm in the first 3 months after HCT. B lymphocyte recovery was significantly compromised in the Tac/Sir arm from 1 month to 6 months after HCT, whereas natural killer cell reconstitution was not affected in the Tac/Sir arm. In the outcomes analysis, higher numbers of CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, and Tregs were associated with better OS. Neither Treg numbers nor the Treg:Tcon ratio was correlated with GVHD. Our findings indicate that Tac/Sir has a more profound T cell suppressive effect than the combination of Tac/MTX in the early post-transplantation period, and particularly compromises the recovery of CD8+ T cells, which have been implicated in aGVHD. Sirolimus used in vivo with tacrolimus does not appear to result in increased absolute numbers of Tregs, but might have a beneficial effect on the Treg:Tcon balance in the first 3 months after transplantation. Nonetheless, no differences in aGVHD or cGVHD between the 2 arms were observed in the parent randomized trial. Calcineurin-inhibitor free, sirolimus-containing GVHD prophylaxis strategies, incorporating other novel agents, should be investigated further to maximize the potential favorable effect of sirolimus on Treg:Tcon balance in the post-transplantation immune repertoire. Sirolimus significantly compromises B cell recovery in the first 6 months post-HCT, with potential complex effects on cGVHD that merit further study.},

  abstract = {Treatment of relapse of hematological malignancies following allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) remains very challenging and relies usually on the readministration of chemotherapy combined with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). To enhance DLI effectiveness, lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine (Flu) and/or CY before the injection of lymphocytes is an attractive modality to modify the immune environment, leading possibly to suppression of regulatory T cells (Treg) and exposing the patient to cytokine activation. However, LD before DLI may lead to induction of deleterious GVHD. To avoid inducing overwhelming toxicity, we proceeded by escalating doses of both LD and DLI. Eighteen patients with various non-CML hematological malignancies who relapsed following allo-HSCT were treated with chemotherapy and LD-DLI or LD-DLI upfront. T-cell subpopulation and DC levels as well as cytokine plasma levels (IL-7, IL-15) were measured before and following LD-DLI. Cumulative incidence of acute grade II\textendash IV GVHD was 29.4\% similar to that reported in patients receiving DLI without LD. In addition, Flu alone with low dose of DLI was not associated with severe GHVD. CY/Flu at the respective doses of 600\,mg/m2 on day 1 and Flu 25\,mg/m2/day on days 1\textendash 3 did not result in a marked decrease of Treg cells, nor in endogenous IL-7 and IL-15 production. However, a peripheral expansion of DCs was observed. These findings suggest that the escalated dose procedure appears safe and prevent overwhelming toxicity. A dose-limiting toxicity has not yet been reached.},

Cytomegalovirus infection is associated with expansion of `adaptive-memory' NK cells with a characteristic CD56dimCD16bright NKG2C+ phenotype but the mechanisms by which this population is maintained remain uncertain.MethodsWe studied NK cell reconstitution in patients undergoing haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and related this to CMV reactivation.ResultsNK cells expanded in the early post-transplant period but then remained stable in the absence of viral reactivation. However, CMV reactivation led to a rapid and sustained 10-fold increase in NK cell number. The proportion of NKG2C-expressing cells increases on all NK subsets although the kinetics of expansion peaked at 6 months on immature CD56bright cells whilst continuing to rise on the mature CD56dim pool. Phenotypic maturation was observed by acquisition of CD57 expression. Effective control of viral reactivation was seen when the peripheral NK cell count reached 20,000/ml.DiscussionThese data show that short term CMV reactivation acts to reprogramme hemopoiesis to drive a sustained modulation and expansion of the NK cell pool and reveal further insight into long term regulation of the innate immune repertoire by infectious challenge.},

Four groups were investigated in detail: recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), recipients of non-- T-cell depleted allografts with GVHD, recipients of T-cell depleted allografts, and recipients of genetically identical twin transplants. Decreased relapse was observed in recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts with acute (relative risk 0.68, P = .03), chronic (relative risk 0.43, P = .01), and both acute and chronic GVDH (relative risk 0.33, P = .0001) as compared with recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect of GVHD. AML patients who received identical twin transplants had an increased probability of relapse (relative risk 2.58, P = .008) compared with allograft recipients without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect of allogeneic grafts independent of GVHD. CML patients who received T-cell depleted transplants with or without GVHD had higher probabilities of relapse (relative risks 4.45 and 6.91, respectively, P = .0001) than recipients of non--T-cell depleted allografts without GVHD. These data support an antileukemia effect independent of GVHD that is altered by T-cell depletion. These results explain the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in eradicating leukemia, provide evidence for a role of the immune system in controlling human cancers, and suggest future directions to improve leukemia therapy.},

  abstract = {Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological research, potentially leading to bias and loss of precision. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete case analysis (CCA). However, contrary to widespread belief, CCA is preferable to MI in some situations.We provide guidance on choice of analysis when data are incomplete. Using causal diagrams to depict missingness mechanisms, we describe when CCA will not be biased by missing data and compare MI and CCA, with respect to bias and efficiency, in a range of missing data situations. We illustrate selection of an appropriate method in practice.For most regression models, CCA gives unbiased results when the chance of being a complete case does not depend on the outcome after taking the covariates into consideration, which includes situations where data are missing not at random. Consequently, there are situations in which CCA analyses are unbiased while MI analyses, assuming missing at random (MAR), are biased. By contrast MI, unlike CCA, is valid for all MAR situations and has the potential to use information contained in the incomplete cases and auxiliary variables to reduce bias and/or improve precision. For this reason, MI was preferred over CCA in our real data example.Choice of method for dealing with missing data is crucial for validity of conclusions, and should be based on careful consideration of the reasons for the missing data, missing data patterns and the availability of auxiliary information.},

Rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin) was administered at a median total dose of 1.75~mg/kg in 16 of the 41 patients. Compared with patients who did not receive ATG, those who did had a significantly smaller number of na\"ive T cells (especially CD4+\,) within three months after allo-HCT. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in the reconstitution of other T cells (effector, memory, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, and Tfh), B cells (transitional, na\"ive, memory, and plasmablast), NK cells (regulatory and cytolytic), or dendritic cells (myeloid and plasmacytoid). Patients with fewer CD4+  na\"ive T cells than the median count (7.60 cells/\textmu L) at two months after allo-HCT developed chronic GVHD less frequently than those with CD4+ na\"ive T cells above the median count (2-year cumulative incidences were 0.31 and 0.53, respectively; p\,=\,0.133). This pilot study suggests low-dose Thymoglobulin suppresses the recovery of na\"ive T cells after allo-HCT, which may contribute to a lower incidence of chronic GVHD.},

  abstract = {In Cox regression, it is important to test the proportional hazards assumption and sometimes of interest in itself to study time-varying effects (TVEs) of covariates. TVEs can be investigated with log hazard ratios modelled as a function of time. Missing data on covariates are common and multiple imputation is a popular approach to handling this to avoid the potential bias and efficiency loss resulting from a ``complete-case'' analysis. Two multiple imputation methods have been proposed for when the substantive model is a Cox proportional hazards regression: an approximate method (Imputing missing covariate values for the Cox model in Statistics in Medicine (2009) by White and Royston) and a substantive-model-compatible method (Multiple imputation of covariates by fully conditional specification: accommodating the substantive model in Statistical Methods in Medical Research (2015) by Bartlett et al). At present, neither accommodates TVEs of covariates. We extend them to do so for a general form for the TVEs and give specific details for TVEs modelled using restricted cubic splines. Simulation studies assess the performance of the methods under several underlying shapes for TVEs. Our proposed methods give approximately unbiased TVE estimates for binary covariates with missing data, but for continuous covariates, the substantive-model-compatible method performs better. The methods also give approximately correct type I errors in the test for proportional hazards when there is no TVE and gain power to detect TVEs relative to complete-case analysis. Ignoring TVEs at the imputation stage results in biased TVE estimates, incorrect type I errors, and substantial loss of power in detecting TVEs. We also propose a multivariable TVE model selection algorithm. The methods are illustrated using data from the Rotterdam Breast Cancer Study. R code is provided.},

In addition, donor-derived alloreactive T cells present in the stem cell product may favor establishment of complete donor-derived hematopoiesis by eliminating patient-derived lymphohematopoietic cells. T cell-depleted alloSCT with sequential transfer of potentially alloreactive T cells by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) provides a unique opportunity to selectively study how competitive repopulation and allo-immunologic pressure influence lymphohematopoietic recovery. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of competitive repopulation and donor-derived anti-recipient alloimmunologic pressure on the establishment of lymphohematopoietic chimerism after alloSCT. In this retrospective cohort study of 281 acute leukemia patients treated according to a protocol combining alemtuzumab-based T cell-depleted alloSCT with prophylactic DLI, we investigated engraftment and quantitative donor chimerism in the BM and immune cell subsets. DLI-induced increase of chimerism and development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were analyzed as complementary indicators for donor-derived anti-recipient alloimmunologic pressure. Profound suppression of patient immune cells by conditioning sufficed for sustained engraftment without necessity for myeloablative conditioning or development of clinically significant GVHD. Although 61\% of the patients without any DLI or GVHD showed full donor chimerism (FDC) in the BM at 6 months after alloSCT, only 24\% showed FDC in the CD4+ T cell compartment. In contrast, 75\% of the patients who had received DLI and 83\% of the patients with clinically significant GVHD had FDC in this compartment. In addition, 72\% of the patients with mixed hematopoiesis receiving DLI converted to complete donor-derived hematopoiesis, of whom only 34\% developed clinically significant GVHD. Our data show that competitive repopulation can be sufficient to reach complete donor-derived hematopoiesis, but that some alloimmunologic pressure is needed for the establishment of a completely donor-derived T cell compartment, either by the development of GVHD or by administration of DLI. We illustrate that it is possible to separate the graft-versus-leukemia effect from GVHD, as conversion to durable complete donor-derived hematopoiesis following DLI did not require induction of clinically significant GVHD.},

Although there is increasing guidance on how to handle missing data, practice is changing slowly and misapprehensions abound, particularly in observational research. Importantly, the lack of transparency around methodological decisions is threatening the validity and reproducibility of modern research. We present a practical framework for handling and reporting the analysis of incomplete data in observational studies, which we illustrate using a case study from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The framework consists of three steps: 1) Develop an analysis plan specifying the analysis model and how missing data are going to be addressed. An important consideration is whether a complete records' analysis is likely to be valid, whether multiple imputation or an alternative approach is likely to offer benefits and whether a sensitivity analysis regarding the missingness mechanism is required; 2) Examine the data, checking the methods outlined in the analysis plan are appropriate, and conduct the preplanned analysis; and 3) Report the results, including a description of the missing data, details on how the missing data were addressed, and the results from all analyses, interpreted in light of the missing data and the clinical relevance. This framework seeks to support researchers in thinking systematically about missing data and transparently reporting the potential effect on the study results, therefore increasing the confidence in and reproducibility of research findings.},

  abstract = {Haploidentical transplantation has become a clinical option for patients lacking a compatible donor. However, patients are still referred at advanced stages and are usually heavily pretreated. This results in a high risk of toxicity, relapses and infections. We therefore started a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) dose-finding protocol, to try to improve both relapse rate and immunity reconstitution. In all, 12 consecutive patients were investigated. All had a refractory, some progressive, disease. Conditioning consisted of TBI, melphalan, ATG, fludarabine and CSA pretransplant. In four rapidly progressive patients, Ara-C had to be given 1 week preconditioning. The graft was T- and B-cell depleted with a fixed reinfused CD3 dose of 5\texttimes 104/kg. All patients engrafted before day 20. G-CSF was given from day 5 post-transplant and replaced with GM-CSF in the last three patients. Nonrelapse related mortality was 0/12 at 1 year. DLI were started at day 28 (3\texttimes 104\,CD3/kg) in the two first patients. This resulted in acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) in both, but they did not relapse. The next dose was 1\texttimes 104/kg monthly for 3 months. This was well tolerated with only one grade I GVHD. Given the high relapse rate, we escalated doses (1, 3 and 10\texttimes 104/kg). This produced GVHD in all. We next moved, to GM-CSF and 1\texttimes 104 CD3/kg monthly. Overall, 6/12 patients relapsed and received therapeutic DLI, starting at 1\texttimes 105 CD3/kg with escalation every 2 weeks. We conclude that prophylactic DLI are feasible in adult haploidentical transplantation, without GVHD at a monthly dose of 1\texttimes 104 CD3/kg. They result in faster CD4 recovery and a low rate of infections. The impact of GM-CSF remains to be further investigated. This scheme seems ideal for patients transplanted early in the course of their disease. In very bad prognosis patients, it remains insufficient to rapidly induce a GVL effect. Escalated doses are feasible but the price is aGVHD. Therapeutic DLI can be given at higher doses, depending on the time post-transplant. Haploidentical transplantation with low-dose DLI is a safe procedure that should be considered in all patients needing a transplant, but lacking a matched donor, early in the course of the disease.},

This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.  An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience Contains an updated and expanded bibliography  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications. Their work "has been no less than defining and transforming." (ISI)Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.},

J Intern Med 2010; 268: 586\textendash 593. Background. Multiple imputation (MI) is an advanced, principled method of dealing with missing data in statistical analyses, a common problem in medical research. This paper sought to document the use of MI in general medical journals and to evaluate the information provided to readers about the application of the procedure in studies. Methods. Research articles using MI in analyses published in JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine, BMJ and the Lancet were identified using full text searches from the earliest date each journal offered such searches until the end of 2008. Ninety-nine articles were found. Studies were classified according to their design. Results. Multiple imputation was used in 49 RCTs and 50 other types of studies. A third of the articles (n = 33) reported no details of the procedure used. In a third of these (n = 11), it was not possible to infer the approach used from references cited or software used. The nature of the imputation model was rarely reported. MI was frequently used as a secondary analysis (n = 40) either to justify reporting a simpler approach or as a form of sensitivity analysis. Conclusions. Whilst still relatively uncommon, the use of MI has risen substantially, particularly in trials. MI is rarely adequately reported, leading to doubt about its appropriateness in some cases. This gives rise to uncertainty about conclusions reached and poses a barrier to attempts to replicate analyses. Guidelines for the reporting of MI should be developed.},

The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for HLA typing in clinical practice provides broader coverage and higher resolution of HLA genes. We evaluated the frequency of DPB1 crossing-over events among patients and potential related donors typed with NGS. From July 2016 to January 2018, 593 patients and 2385 siblings were typed. We evaluated sibling matching status in 546 patients, and 44.8\% of these patients had siblings that matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci. In 306 patient\textendash HLA matched sibling pairs, we found 6 pairs (1.96\%) with 1 DPB1 mismatch, and 5 of these pairs included an additional mismatch in DPA1. No additional mismatches were observed at the low expression loci. Using the T cell epitope algorithm, 4 of these DP mismatches were classified as permissive, 1 as nonpermissive in the host-versus-graft direction, and 1 as nonpermissive in the graft-versus-host direction. The frequency of DPB1 and DPA1 mismatches is low, and their impact in related donor transplants is not well established. Although DP typing in related transplants goes beyond guidelines, it is especially relevant for sensitized patients. NGS-based HLA typing provides full gene coverage, and its use in clinical practice can enable better donor selection.},

To address this gap in knowledge, we used machine learning to decipher clinically relevant signatures from immunophenotypic, proteomic, and clinical data and then examined transcriptome changes in the lymphocyte subsets that predicted major posttransplant outcomes. Kinetics of immune subset reconstitution after day 28 were similar for 70 patients undergoing haplo and 75 patients undergoing HLA-matched BMT. Machine learning based on 35 candidate factors (10 clinical, 18 cellular, and 7 proteomic) revealed that combined elevations in effector CD4+ conventional T cells (Tconv) and CXCL9 at day 28 predicted acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Furthermore, higher NK cell counts predicted improved overall survival (OS) due to a reduction in both nonrelapse mortality and relapse. Transcriptional and flow-cytometric analyses of recovering lymphocytes in patients with aGVHD identified preserved hallmarks of functional CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) while highlighting a Tconv-driven inflammatory and metabolic axis distinct from that seen with conventional GVHD prophylaxis. Patients developing early relapse displayed a loss of inflammatory gene signatures in NK cells and a transcriptional exhaustion phenotype in CD8+ T cells. Using a multimodality approach, we highlight the utility of systems biology in BMT biomarker discovery and offer a novel understanding of how PTCy influences alloimmune responses. Our work charts future directions for novel therapeutic interventions after these increasingly used GVHD prophylaxis platforms.

The first is to investigate how the calibration of the prediction rule can be combined with use of multiple imputation to account for missing predictor observations. The second objective is to propose such methods that can be implemented with current multiple imputation software, while allowing for unbiased predictive assessment through validation on new observations for which outcome is not yet available. We commence with a review of the methodological foundations of multiple imputation as a model estimation approach as opposed to a purely algorithmic description. We specifically contrast application of multiple imputation for parameter (effect) estimation with predictive calibration. Based on this review, two approaches are formulated, of which the second utilizes application of the classical Rubin's rules for parameter estimation, while the first approach averages probabilities from models fitted on single imputations to directly approximate the predictive density for future observations. We present implementations using current software that allow for validation and estimation of performance measures by cross-validation, as well as imputation of missing data in predictors on the future data where outcome is missing by definition. To simplify, we restrict discussion to binary outcome and logistic regression throughout. Method performance is verified through application on two real data sets. Accuracy (Brier score) and variance of predicted probabilities are investigated. Results show substantial reductions in variation of calibrated probabilities when using the first approach.},

In addition to effector cells, infusions contain CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) that may suppress graft-versus-tumor responses. We undertook a phase I study of donor lymphocyte infusions depleted of CD25+ T cells in patients with hematologic malignancies who had relapsed after transplantation. Twenty-one subjects received CD25/Treg-depleted infusions following removal of CD25+ cells using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Sixteen subjects received prior cytoreductive therapy. Four were in complete remission at the time of infusion. Two dose levels were administered: 1\texttimes 107 (n=6) and 3\texttimes 107 CD3+ cells/kg (n=15). A median 2.3 log-depletion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg was achieved. Seven subjects (33\%) developed clinically significant graft-versus-host disease by 1 year, including one patient who died. At dose level 1, five subjects had progressive disease and one had stable disease. At dose level 2, nine subjects (60\%) achieved or maintained responses (8 complete responses, 1 partial response), including seven with active disease at the time of infusion. A shorter period between relapse and infusion was associated with response at dose level 2 (P=0.016). The 1-year survival rate was 53\% among patients treated with dose level 2. Four of eight subjects with acute myeloid leukemia remained in remission at 1 year. When compared to unmodified donor lymphocyte infusions in 14 contemporaneous patients meeting study eligibility, CD25/Treg depletion was associated with a better response rate and improved event-free survival. Circulating na\"ive and central memory CD4+ T cells increased after CD25/Treg-depleted infusion, but no immunophenotypic signature for response was noted. CD25/Treg-depleted donor infusion appears feasible and capable of inducing graft-versus-tumor responses without excessive graft-versus-host disease. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT\#00675831)},

  abstract = {Missing data are a common challenge encountered in research which can compromise the results of statistical inference when not handled appropriately. This paper aims to introduce basic concepts of missing data to a non-statistical audience, list and compare some of the most popular approaches for handling missing data in practice and provide guidelines and recommendations for dealing with and reporting missing data in scientific research. Complete case analysis and single imputation are simple approaches for handling missing data and are popular in practice, however, in most cases they are not guaranteed to provide valid inferences. Multiple imputation is a robust and general alternative which is appropriate for data missing at random, surpassing the disadvantages of the simpler approaches, but should always be conducted with care. The aforementioned approaches are illustrated and compared in an example application using Cox regression.},

  abstract = {We aimed to study the prognostic impact of the mutational landscape in primary and secondary myelofibrosis. The study included 479 patients with myelofibrosis recruited from 24 French Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM) centers. The molecular landscape was studied by high-throughput sequencing of 77 genes. A Bayesian network allowed the identification of genomic groups whose prognostic impact was studied in a multistate model considering transitions from the 3 conditions: Myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, and death. Results were validated using an independent, previously published cohort (n 5 276). Four genomic groups were identified: Patients with TP53 mutation; patients with \$1 mutation in EZH2, CBL, U2AF1, SRSF2, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, or KRAS (highrisk group); patients with ASXL1-only mutation (ie, no associated mutation in TP53 or highrisk genes); and other patients. A multistate model found that both TP53 and high-risk groups were associated with leukemic transformation (hazard ratios [HRs] [95\% confidence interval], 8.68 [3.32-22.73] and 3.24 [1.58-6.64], respectively) and death from myelofibrosis (HRs, 3.03 [1.66-5.56] and 1.77 [1.18-2.67], respectively). ASXL1-only mutations had no prognostic value that was confirmed in the validation cohort. However, ASXL1 mutations conferred a worse prognosis when associated with a mutation in TP53 or high-risk genes. This study provides a new definition of adverse mutations in myelofibrosis with the addition of TP53, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, and U2AF1 to previously described genes. Furthermore, our results argue that ASXL1 mutations alone cannot be considered detrimental.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.},

In the present study, we determined NK cell death in vitro using propidium iodide and Annexin V. The NK cell activity in 34 patients at day +30 after allogeneic HSCT was assessed using the CD107a assay. Alemtuzumab and thymoglobulin were similarly very potent in inducing NK cell death in vitro. Even in low concentrations ({$<$}1\,{$\mu$}g/ml) the antibodies induced apoptosis and necrosis in a relevant percentage of NK cells ({$>$}30\%). However, the number of tumor reactive (CD107a+) NK cells was 13.16 per {$\mu$}l and 1.15 per {$\mu$}l (mean) in patients receiving T-cell depletion with 6\,mg/kg thymoglobulin and in patients receiving 100\,mg alemtuzumab, respectively (P=0.02). Although thymoglobulin and alemtuzumab are equally NK cell toxic in vitro, the recovery of NK cell frequency and anti-tumor reactivity is reduced in recipients of alemtuzumab. Our findings can be explained by a longer half-life of alemtuzumab as compared to active thymoglobulin under therapeutic conditions. Prolonged immunosuppression with increased risk of infections and tumor relapse are a potential threat to patients undergoing HCST and receiving alemtuzumab as T-cell depletion.},

Informed by previous experience from Europe, North America and Australasia, the Clinical Outcomes Group (COG) established criteria for patient and Center selection, and a set of key clinical variables within a dedicated statistical model adapted to the capabilities of the EBMT Registry. The first phase of the project was launched in 2019 to test the acceptability of the benchmarking model through assessment of Centers' performance for 1-year data completeness and survival outcomes of autologous and allogeneic HSCT covering 2013\textendash 2016. A second phase was delivered in July 2021 covering 2015\textendash 2019 and including survival outcomes. Reports of individual Center performance were shared directly with local principal investigators and their responses were assimilated. The experience thus far has supported the feasibility, acceptability and reliability of the system as well as identifying its limitations. We provide a summary of experience and learning so far in this `work in progress', as well as highlighting future challenges of delivering a modern, robust, data-complete, risk-adapted benchmarking program across new EBMT Registry systems.},

  abstract = {Rapid immune reconstitution (IR) following stem cell transplantation (SCT) is essential for a favorable outcome. The optimization of graft composition should not only enable a sufficient IR but also improve graft vs. leukemia/tumor effects, overcome infectious complications and, finally, improve patient survival. Especially in haploidentical SCT, the optimization of graft composition is controversial. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of graft manipulation on IR in 40 patients with acute leukemia in remission. We examined the cell recovery post haploidentical SCT in patients receiving a CD34+-selected or CD3/CD19-depleted graft, considering the applied conditioning regimen. We used joint model analysis for overall survival (OS) and analyzed the dynamics of age-adjusted leukocytes; lymphocytes; monocytes; CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ T cells; natural killer (NK) cells; and B cells over the course of time after SCT. Lymphocytes, NK cells, and B cells expanded more rapidly after SCT with CD34+-selected grafts (P\,=\,0.036, P\,=\,0.002, and P\,{$<$}\,0.001, respectively). Contrarily, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells recovered delayer in the CD34 selected group (P\,=\,0.026). Furthermore, reduced intensity conditioning facilitated faster immune recovery of lymphocytes and T cells and their subsets (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). However, the immune recovery for NK cells and B cells was comparable for patients who received reduced-intensity or full preparative regimens. Dynamics of all cell types had a significant influence on OS, which did not differ between patients receiving CD34+-selected and those receiving CD3/CD19-depleted grafts. In conclusion, cell reconstitution dynamics showed complex diversity with regard to the graft manufacturing procedure and conditioning regimen.},

Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for patients {$<$}45-year old at transplant was 7\% rising to 25\% for patients aged {$\geq$}65. For older patients, 31\% of NRM-deaths could be attributed to population mortality. Favorable post-alloHCT long-term survival was seen; however, excess mortality-risk for all age groups was shown compared to the general population. A substantial part of total NRM for older patients was attributable to population mortality, information which aids the balanced explanation of post-HCT risk and helps improve long-term care.},

We used immunophenotyping to measure the absolute numbers of CD4+, CD8+, NK, and CD56+ T cells and their respective subsets in patients' peripheral blood one day before DLI (d-1) and compared the results at day + 1 and + 7 post DLI to the values before DLI. After the administration of 1 \texttimes{} 106 CD3+ cells/kg body weight, we observed an overall increase in the CD8+ and CD56+ T cell counts. We determined significant changes between day - 1 compared to day + 1 and day + 7 in memory and activated CD8+ subsets and CD56+ T cells. Applying a higher dose of DLI (5 \texttimes{} 106 CD3+ cells/kg) led to a significant increase in the overall counts and subsets of CD8+, CD4+, and NK cells. In conclusion, serial immune phenotyping in the peripheral blood of DLI recipients revealed significant changes in immune effector cells, in particular for various CD8+ T cell subtypes, indicating proliferation and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is a standard of care for relapse of acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Currently it is poorly understood how and when CD8+ {$\alpha\beta$} T cells exert graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity after DLI. Also, there is no reliable biomarker to monitor GVL activity of the infused CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we analyzed the dynamics of CD8+ {$\alpha\beta$} T-cell clones in patients with DLI. In this prospective clinical study of 29 patients, we performed deep T-cell receptor {$\beta$} (TRB ) sequencing of sorted CD8+ {$\alpha\beta$} T cells to track patients' repertoire changes in response to DLI. Upon first occurrence of GVL, longitudinal analyses revealed a preferential expansion of distinct CD8+TRB clones (n = 14). This did not occur in samples of patients without signs of GVL (n = 11). Importantly, early repertoire changes 15 days after DLI predicted durable remission for the 36-month study follow-up. Furthermore, absence of clonal outgrowth of the CD8+TRB repertoire after DLI was an early biomarker that predicted relapse at a median time of 11.2 months ahead of actual diagnosis. Additionally, unbiased sample analysis regardless of the clinical outcome revealed that patients with decreasing CD8+TRB diversity at day 15 after DLI (n = 13) had a lower relapse incidence (P = .0040) compared with patients without clonal expansion (n = 6). In conclusion, CD8+TRB analysis may provide a reliable tool for predicting the efficacy of DLI and holds the potential to identify patients at risk for progression and relapse after DLI.},

  abstract = {Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) is commonly used for imputing missing data in epidemiologic research. The ``true'' imputation model may contain nonlinearities which are not included in default imputation models. Random forest imputation is a machine learning technique which can accommodate nonlinearities and interactions and does not require a particular regression model to be specified. We compared parametric MICE with a random forest-based MICE algorithm in 2 simulation studies. The first study used 1,000 random samples of 2,000 persons drawn from the 10,128 stable angina patients in the CALIBER database (Cardiovascular Disease Research using Linked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Records; 2001\textendash 2010) with complete data on all covariates. Variables were artificially made ``missing at random,'' and the bias and efficiency of parameter estimates obtained using different imputation methods were compared. Both MICE methods produced unbiased estimates of (log) hazard ratios, but random forest was more efficient and produced narrower confidence intervals. The second study used simulated data in which the partially observed variable depended on the fully observed variables in a nonlinear way. Parameter estimates were less biased using random forest MICE, and confidence interval coverage was better. This suggests that random forest imputation may be useful for imputing complex epidemiologic data sets in which some patients have missing data.},

There are few multicenter studies defining prognostic factors in pediatric patients with tMNs. We have accumulated the largest cohort of pediatric patients who have undergone HCT for a tMN to perform a multivariate analysis defining factors predictive of long-term survival. Sixty-eight percent of the 401 patients underwent HCT using a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen, but there were no statistically significant differences in the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), or cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality based on the conditioning intensity. Among the recipients of MAC regimens, 38.4\% of deaths were from treatment-related causes, especially acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and end-organ failure, as compared to only 20.9\% of deaths in the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) cohort. Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) during conditioning and experiencing grade III/IV acute GVHD was associated with worse OS. In addition, a diagnosis of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and having a structurally complex karyotype at tMN diagnosis were associated with worse EFS.

The morbidity and mortality from clinically significant acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a limitation. The extent to which transplantation outcome may be improved with donor matching for HLA-DP is not well defined. The risks of aGVHD, relapse, and mortality associated with HLA-DPB1 allele mismatching were determined in 5929 patients who received a myeloablative HCT from an HLA-A\textendash, HLA-B\textendash, HLA-C\textendash, HLA-DRB1\textendash, and HLA-DQB1\textendash matched or \textendash mismatched donor. There was a statistically significantly higher risk of both grades 2 to 4 aGVHD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33; P \&lt; .001) and grades 3 to 4 aGVHD (OR = 1.26; P \&lt; .001) after HCT from an HLA-DPB1\textendash mismatched donor compared with a matched donor. The increased risk of aGVHD was accompanied by a statistically significantly decrease in disease relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82; P = .01). HLA-DPB1 functions as a classical transplantation antigen. The increased risk of GVHD associated with HLA-DPB1 mismatching is accompanied by a lower risk of relapse. Knowledge of the DPB1 matching status prior to transplantation will aid in more precise risk stratification for the individual patient.},

Natural killer (NK) cells are the first donor-derived lymphocyte subset to recover after HCT, and their crucial role in protection against cancer relapse and infections is well established. Conversely, the role played by NK cells in GvHD is still controversial. Early studies suggested a participation of NK cells in GvHD induction or exacerbation. Subsequently, experimental evidence obtained in mice as well observational studies performed in humans led to a model in which NK cells play a regulatory role in GvHD by repressing alloreactive T cell responses. This widely accepted model has been recently challenged by clinical evidence indicating that NK cells can in some cases promote GvHD. In this review, we summarize available knowledge about the role of NK cells in GVHD pathogenesis. We review studies uncovering cellular mechanisms through which NK cells interact with other immune cell subsets during GvHD leading to a model in which NK cells naturally suppress GvHD through their cytotoxic ability to inhibit T cell activation unless exogenous hyperactivation lead them to produce proinflammatory cytokines that can conversely sustain T cell-mediated GvHD induction.},

In several countries inside and outside Europe, benchmarking systems have been established for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but access is not universal. As benchmarking is now integrated into the FACT-JACIE standards, the EBMT and JACIE established a Clinical Outcomes Group (COG) to develop and introduce a universal system accessible across EBMT members. Established systems from seven European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland), USA and Australia were appraised, revealing similarities in process, but wide variations in selection criteria and statistical methods. In tandem, the COG developed the first phase of a bespoke risk-adapted international benchmarking model for one-year survival following allogeneic and autologous HSCT based on current capabilities within the EBMT registry core dataset. Data completeness, which has a critical impact on validity of centre comparisons, is also assessed. Ongoing development will include further scientific validation of the model, incorporation of further variables (when appropriate) alongside implementation of systems for clinically meaningful interpretation and governance aiming to maximise acceptance to centres, clinicians, payers and patients across EBMT.},

Here, we use mass cytometry to define patterns of innate and adaptive immune cell reconstitution at key phases of human cytomegalovirus reactivation in the first 100 days post haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Human cytomegalovirus reactivation is associated with the development of activated, memory T-cell profiles, with faster effector-memory CD4+ T-cell recovery in patients with low-level versus high-level human cytomegalovirus DNAemia. Mucosal-associated invariant T cell levels at the initial detection of human cytomegalovirus DNAemia are significantly lower in patients who subsequently develop high-level versus low-level human cytomegalovirus reactivation. Our data describe distinct immune signatures that emerged with human cytomegalovirus reactivation after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and highlight Mucosal-associated invariant T cell levels at the first detection of reactivation as a marker that may be useful to anticipate the magnitude of human cytomegalovirus DNAemia.},

  abstract = {The use of multiple imputation has increased markedly in recent years, and journal reviewers may expect to see multiple imputation used to handle missing data. However in randomized trials, where treatment group is always observed and independent of baseline covariates, other approaches may be preferable. Using data simulation we evaluated multiple imputation, performed both overall and separately by randomized group, across a range of commonly encountered scenarios. We considered both missing outcome and missing baseline data, with missing outcome data induced under missing at random mechanisms. Provided the analysis model was correctly specified, multiple imputation produced unbiased treatment effect estimates, but alternative unbiased approaches were often more efficient. When the analysis model overlooked an interaction effect involving randomized group, multiple imputation produced biased estimates of the average treatment effect when applied to missing outcome data, unless imputation was performed separately by randomized group. Based on these results, we conclude that multiple imputation should not be seen as the only acceptable way to handle missing data in randomized trials. In settings where multiple imputation is adopted, we recommend that imputation is carried out separately by randomized group.},

  abstract = {Background/aims:After completion of a randomised controlled trial, an extended follow-up period may be initiated to learn about longer term impacts of the intervention. Since extended follow-up studies often involve additional eligibility restrictions and consent processes for participation, and a longer duration of follow-up entails a greater risk of participant attrition, missing data can be a considerable threat in this setting. As a potential source of bias, it is critical that missing data are appropriately handled in the statistical analysis, yet little is known about the treatment of missing data in extended follow-up studies. The aims of this review were to summarise the extent of missing data in extended follow-up studies and the use of statistical approaches to address this potentially serious problem.Methods:We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed to identify extended follow-up studies published from January to June 2015. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the original randomised controlled trial results were also published and if the main objective of extended follow-up was to compare the original randomised groups. We recorded information on the extent of missing data and the approach used to treat missing data in the statistical analysis of the primary outcome of the extended follow-up study.Results:Of the 81 studies included in the review, 36 (44\%) reported additional eligibility restrictions and 24 (30\%) consent processes for entry into extended follow-up. Data were collected at a median of 7?years after randomisation. Excluding 28 studies with a time to event primary outcome, 51/53 studies (96\%) reported missing data on the primary outcome. The median percentage of randomised participants with complete data on the primary outcome was just 66\% in these studies. The most common statistical approach to address missing data was complete case analysis (51\% of studies), while likelihood-based analyses were also well represented (25\%). Sensitivity analyses around the missing data mechanism were rarely performed (25\% of studies), and when they were, they often involved unrealistic assumptions about the mechanism.Conclusion:Despite missing data being a serious problem in extended follow-up studies, statistical approaches to addressing missing data were often inadequate. We recommend researchers clearly specify all sources of missing data in follow-up studies and use statistical methods that are valid under a plausible assumption about the missing data mechanism. Sensitivity analyses should also be undertaken to assess the robustness of findings to assumptions about the missing data mechanism.},

Lymphocyte recovery and clinical outcomes in 41 allograft recipients conditioned using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and 4.5-Gy total body irradiation were studied to determine if immune reconstitution could be described as a dynamical system. Survival, relapse, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were not significantly different in 2 cohorts of patients receiving different doses of ATG. However, donor-derived CD3+ cell reconstitution was superior in the lower ATG dose cohort, and there were fewer instances of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Lymphoid recovery was plotted in each individual over time and demonstrated 1 of 3 sigmoid growth patterns: Pattern A (n~= 15) had rapid growth with high lymphocyte counts, pattern B (n~= 14) had slower growth with intermediate recovery, and pattern C (n~= 10) had poor lymphocyte reconstitution. There was a significant association between lymphocyte recovery patterns and both the rate of change of donor-derived CD3+ at day 30 after stem cell transplantation (SCT) and clinical outcomes. GVHD was observed more frequently with pattern A, relapse and DLI more so with pattern C, with a consequent survival advantage in patients with patterns A and B. We conclude that evaluating immune reconstitution after SCT as a dynamical system may differentiate patients at risk of adverse outcomes and allow early intervention to modulate that risk.},

Results A total of 23 CPMs were included through ``sampling strategy.'' Six missing data strategies were identified: complete case analysis (CCA), multiple imputation, imputation of mean values, k-nearest neighbours imputation, using an additional category for missingness, considering missing values as risk-factor-absent. 52\% of the development articles and 48\% of the validation articles did not report how missing data were handled. CCA was the most common approach used for development (40\%) and validation (44\%). At implementation, 57\% of the CPMs required complete data entry, whilst 43\% allowed missing values. Three CPMs had consistent paths in their pipelines. Conclusion A broad variety of methods for handling missing data underly the CPMs currently recommended for use in UK healthcare. Missing data handling strategies were generally inconsistent. Better quality assurance of CPMs needs greater clarity and consistency in handling of missing data.},

We found that T cells of patients relapsing with AML after allo-HCT exhibited reduced glycolysis and interferon-{$\gamma$} production. Functional studies in multiple mouse models of leukemia showed that leukemia-derived lactic acid (LA) interfered with T cell glycolysis and proliferation. Mechanistically, LA reduced intracellular pH in T cells, led to lower transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes, and decreased activity of essential metabolic pathways. Metabolic reprogramming by sodium bicarbonate (NaBi) reversed the LA-induced low intracellular pH, restored metabolite concentrations, led to incorporation of LA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle as an additional energy source, and enhanced graft-versus-leukemia activity of murine and human T cells. NaBi treatment of post\textendash allo-HCT patients with relapsed AML improved metabolic fitness and interferon-{$\gamma$} production in T cells. Overall, we show that metabolic reprogramming of donor T cells is a pharmacological strategy for patients with relapsed AML after allo-HCT.},

Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagrams are also included. The STROBE Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.strobe-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of observational research.},

  abstract = {Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has allowed the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for haematological malignancies in elderly patients. A major problem of this type of transplantation is the high incidence of persisting chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The inclusion of alemtuzumab added to the graft ('Campath in the bag') for donor T-cell depletion offers an easy procedure to diminish the incidence of GvHD. Good engraftment is observed in most patients, whereas almost no GvHD is observed after transplantation. Most patients become mixed chimeric after transplantation, requiring donor lymphocyte infusion for conversion to full donor chimerism. Although subsequent acute and chronic GvHD is observed in 50-60\% of patients, it is responsive to therapy in many patients, resulting in a low incidence of persisting chronic GvHD. AlloSCT with RIC and alemtuzumab-induced T-cell depletion offers a suitable platform for the investigation of novel cellular immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {When using multiple imputation, users often want to know how many imputations they need. An old answer is that 2\textendash 10 imputations usually suffice, but this recommendation only addresses the efficiency of point estimates. You may need more imputations if, in addition to efficient point estimates, you also want standard error (SE) estimates that would not change (much) if you imputed the data again. For replicable SE estimates, the required number of imputations increases quadratically with the fraction of missing information (not linearly, as previous studies have suggested). I recommend a two-stage procedure in which you conduct a pilot analysis using a small-to-moderate number of imputations, then use the results to calculate the number of imputations that are needed for a final analysis whose SE estimates will have the desired level of replicability. I implement the two-stage procedure using a new SAS macro called \%mi\_combine and a new Stata command called how\_many\_imputations.},

However, when baseline data are partly missing, analysis of complete cases is inefficient. We consider various possible improvements in the case of normally distributed baseline and outcome variables. Joint modelling of baseline and outcome is the most efficient method. Mean imputation is an excellent alternative, subject to three conditions. Firstly, if baseline and outcome are correlated more than about 0.6 then weighting should be used to allow for the greater information from complete cases. Secondly, imputation should be carried out in a deterministic way, using other baseline variables if possible, but not using randomized arm or outcome. Thirdly, if baselines are not missing completely at random, then a dummy variable for missingness should be included as a covariate (the missing indicator method). The methods are illustrated in a randomized trial in community psychiatry. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {When missing data occur in one or more covariates in a regression model, multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete-case analysis (CC). We use theoretical arguments and simulation studies to compare these methods with MI implemented under a missing at random assumption. When data are missing completely at random, both methods have negligible bias, and MI is more efficient than CC across a wide range of scenarios. For other missing data mechanisms, bias arises in one or both methods. In our simulation setting, CC is biased towards the null when data are missing at random. However, when missingness is independent of the outcome given the covariates, CC has negligible bias and MI is biased away from the null. With more general missing data mechanisms, bias tends to be smaller for MI than for CC. Since MI is not always better than CC for missing covariate problems, the choice of method should take into account what is known about the missing data mechanism in a particular substantive application. Importantly, the choice of method should not be based on comparison of standard errors. We propose new ways to understand empirical differences between MI and CC, which may provide insights into the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying each method, and we propose a new index for assessing the likely gain in precision from MI: the fraction of incomplete cases among the observed values of a covariate (FICO).

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and is typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in regression analysis when covariates have missing values. Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on the outcome. With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is not clear. We assume that the survival outcome follows a proportional hazards model given covariates X and Z. We show that a suitable model for imputing binary or Normal X is a logistic or linear regression on the event indicator D, the cumulative baseline hazard H0(T), and the other covariates Z. This result is exact in the case of a single binary covariate; in other cases, it is approximately valid for small covariate effects and/or small cumulative incidence. If we do not know H0(T), we approximate it by the Nelson\textendash Aalen estimator of H(T) or estimate it by Cox regression. We compare the methods using simulation studies. We find that using logT biases covariate-outcome associations towards the null, while the new methods have lower bias. Overall, we recommend including the event indicator and the Nelson\textendash Aalen estimator of H(T) in the imputation model. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Younger age at transplant has been identified as the most important positive prognostic factor for favourable IR post-transplant and, indeed, accelerated immune cell recovery in children is most likely the pivotal contributing factor to lower incidences of GvHD and infectious complications in paediatric allogeneic HCT. Although our knowledge about the mechanisms of IR has significantly increased over the recent years, strategies to influence IR are just evolving. In this review, we will discuss different patterns of IR during various time points post-transplant and their impact on outcome. Besides IR patterns and cellular phenotypes, recovery of antigen-specific immune cells, for example virus-specific T cells, has recently gained increasing interest, as certain threshold levels of antigen-specific T cells seem to confer protection against severe viral disease courses. In contrast, the association between IR and a possible graft-vs. leukaemia effect is less well-understood. Finally, we will present current concepts of how to improve IR and how this could change transplant procedures in the near future.},
